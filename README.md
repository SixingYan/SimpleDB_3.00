# An Advanced Version of BC-SimpleDB

## 1. Introduction
**What is SimpleDB**  
The [SimpleDB](http://cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/intro.html) here is developed by Boston College, which is not related to Amazon SimpleDB totally.  
> SimpleDB is a multi-user transactional database server written in Java, which interacts with Java client programs via JDBC. The system is intended for pedagogical use only. ---[Edward Sciore](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~sciore)

**Goal**  
The original code of SimpleDB is called SimpleDB v2.10 (January 1, 2013), and the advanced version we created here is called SimpleDB v3.00. This project is a course project of CS542 Database Management System, aiming to learn and practice the study of index technology in database system.   

First, several tree-based and hash-based indexing were developed. Next, related functionalities of index were implemented. Then, an impersonate client was developed for running test cases. Finally, evaluation modules were created to assess the new features.

**Dataset**  
The academic dataset of Yelp ([link](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)) is employed for developing test cases.  
The preprocess sql sets of the dataset generated by the [tool](https://github.com/SixingYan/yelp_dataset_process) is available in this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mC5NTh6YyJCzX-ojfaIYebUBnvIjUKED).
